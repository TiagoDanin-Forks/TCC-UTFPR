# Term Paper / Repository
In this repository, you will find all the files related to the processes of data collection and chart creation used in Luiz Felipe's research. You will be able to reproduce and modify both of these processes based on the scripts we made available in this repository. We also provide our website source code if you want to be inspired by it to create new projects. If you experience problems while running these codes, please, feel free to contact us.

## Data Collection
The data collection process is based on two collection sources: <b>GitHub API </b> (V3) and <b>Git Repositories</b>. Data available in the API are collected using web requisitions in python, and data available in the repositories are collected using <i>git logs</i> in shellscript. All the source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/fronchetti/TCC-UTFPR/tree/master/Crawler">Crawler<a> folder. However, to make it simpler, we created a class that abstracts the execution process. If you want to reproduce our dataset, just execute <a href="https://github.com/fronchetti/TCC-UTFPR/blob/master/data_collector.py">this script</a>.
